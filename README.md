# Getting Started
Front-end UI to do a work demo.
Backend: No backend, only faked data.

### Flow
- Get a list from the Backend
- Display that list
- Ability to display extra details of one element of that list.
- Routing to handle back actions

### Development server
Looked at the AngularCLI here:
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Build
Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.


Notes: Some standards.standard are sometime Object sometime Array. It was modified to be more uniform.
